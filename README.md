Technical writing and academic publications are a large part of the academic environment, where researches and students develop novel approaches aiming to solve foreseen problems and others that have not even reveled itself yet. This industry has significant impact on new technologies and itself movement a large sum of money. The process of submitting a paper involves great amount of work and resources for development and revision rounds with peers and editors. Publication in a peer-reviewed journal can be a lengthy and often exhausting process.

The acceptance process can take a couple months or even years. Therefore, knowing which journal to target, topics that are generally published or are in more evidence, and common expressions and words used by other authors that published in the same venue, can help the researcher to polish his work seeking for better fit to the journal editorsâ€™ expectations. Finally, the goal is to increase the chances of having the paper accepted and speed up the publishing process.

In this study, we acquire data from published scientific research articles on the practice of management in two major scholarly journals, Manufacturing & Service Operation Management (MSOM) and Management and Science (MNSC). We investigate the important aspects of the papers such as the most common discussed topics, top authors and affiliations, and time for acceptance and publication, over the past 15 years.

The main contribution is to provide high quality information that can assist researchers in the processes of selecting a target journal for publication and writing the paper according to the characteristics of the venue.
