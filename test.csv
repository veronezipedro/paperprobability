In this paper we quantify how empirically calibrated model errors concerning the futures term structure affect the valuation and hedging of natural gas storage. We find that even small model errors—on the order of 1%–2% of the empirical futures price variance—can have a disproportionate impact on storage valuation and hedging. In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches.

To address procurement cost fluctuation, the firm adopts a dual-sourcing strategy, under which it procures from a spot market with immediate delivery and through a forward-buying contract with postponed delivery. Our analysis offers the unique insight that a risk-neutral firm may earn higher expected profit under a more volatile procurement cost process. This is because the firm makes its pricing and sourcing decisions in response to the realized cost in each period. Moreover, we characterize how the firm should dynamically adjust its pricing and sourcing decisions in accordance to cost evolution. For example, if sourcing through the forward-buying contract is less expensive than sourcing directly from the spot market, the optimal safety stock is decreasing in the current spot market purchasing cost. However, the optimal order quantity through the forward-buying contract is, in general, not monotone in the current spot-purchasing cost. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that dynamic pricing and dual sourcing may be either strategic complements or substitutes in the presence of fluctuating procurement costs and uncertain demand.

At the end of a harvest season, the winemaker obtains a certain number of barrels of wine that can be produced for a particular vintage. While the wine is aging in the barrel, expert reviewers taste the wine and create a barrel score, indicating the potential quality of the wine and offering clues as to whether, when bottled, it will be superior wine. Based on the barrel score, the wine producer determines (1) the percentage of its wine to be sold as futures and (2) the price of the wine futures. After one more year of aging, the wine is bottled, and the reviewers provide a second review of the wine and assign a bottle score that influences the market price of the wine. Our study makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model that incorporates uncertain consumer valuations of wine futures and bottled wine and the uncertain bottle rating that is assigned to the wine at the end of the production process. Our analysis provides insights into how the barrel score, consumer preference (through a conditional-value-at-risk perspective) and the winemaker’s preference influence the winemaker’s allocation and pricing decisions. Our second contribution relates to the impact of consumer heterogeneity on the optimal allocation and pricing decisions. Contrary to common belief that the winemaker may be better off when consumers are more homogeneous, our results demonstrate that the winemaker can achieve a higher level of profitability when the market is filled with consumers that are heterogeneous. Third, we test our findings using data collected from Bordeaux wineries engaging in wine futures. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that (1) barrel scores play a significant role in the two decisions regarding the quantity and price of wine futures, and (2) the wine futures market provides a sizable financial benefit to the winemakers.

Our analysis highlights that the effectiveness of these strategies depends critically on whether a brand-name company faces a nondeceptive or deceptive counterfeiter. For example, by improving quality, the brand-name company can improve her expected profit against a nondeceptive counterfeiter when the counterfeiter steals an insignificant amount of brand value. However, the same strategy does not work well against the deceptive counterfeiter unless high quality facilitates the seizure of deceptive counterfeits significantly. Similarly, reducing price works well in combating the nondeceptive counterfeiter, but it could be ineffective against the deceptive counterfeiter.

When a retailer forecasts demand based on past sales observations, it requires an estimation approach that accounts for this censoring. Several authors have analyzed inventory management with demand learning in environments with censored observations, but the authors assume that inventory levels are known and hence that stockouts are observed. However, firms often do not know how many units of inventory are available to meet demand, a phenomenon known as inventory record inaccuracy.

The worst-case distribution has a practical interpretation with disruption propagation, and its sparse structure allows solving the problem efficiently. Our numerical results show that ignoring disruption correlation could lead to significant loss that increases dramatically in key factors such as source disaster probability, disruption propagation effect, and service interruption penalty. On the other hand, the robust model results in very low regret, even when disruptions are independent, and starts to outperform the model assuming independence when disruptions are mildly correlated.

Specifically, we consider a firm that must choose capacities of resources that will be used to satisfy stochastic demand for multiple products, where demands follow a multivariate normal distribution. Prior to the capacity decision, the firm receives information revealing either the total volume of demand across products or the mix of demand between products. We examine two different scenarios: a dedicated resource setting with product-specific resources and a common resource scenario with one flexible resource. For both scenarios we derive the distribution of the (possibly imperfect) volume or mix demand signal, as well as the conditional distributions of demand given the particular signal. We explore the impact of either type of information on optimal capacities and profit. We find that commonality and volume information are strategic complements—so that it is more valuable to obtain volume information in settings with a common resource. On the other hand, commonality and mix information are strategic substitutes. Moreover, we find that mix and volume information themselves are complements in systems with dedicated resources.

In this paper, we study the impact of two major barriers to mass adoption of EVs: (i) range anxiety, the concern that the driving range of EVs may be insufficient to meet the driving needs, and (ii) resale anxiety, the concern that used values of EVs may deteriorate quickly. Using a stylized model calibrated to a data set based on the San Francisco Bay Area, we show that although both types of consumer anxieties typically harm the firm’s profit, they often improve consumer surplus. In addition, we show that a business model that requires consumers to lease the EV batteries (rather than purchase them) may lead to a greater level of adoption and emission savings when the level of resale anxiety is high. Further, a business model that offers EV range improvement through enhanced charging infrastructure typically yields greater adoption and consumer surplus, but lowers the firm’s profit, compared with one that offers enlarged batteries. Overall, we find that the combinations of battery owning/leasing with enhanced charging service, referred to as the (O, E) and (L, E) models in our paper, typically yield the best balance among the objectives of EV adoption, emission savings, profitability, and consumer surplus, when the degree of resale anxiety is low and high, respectively.",633.0,2014,"[(u'consumer', 5), (u'adoption', 4), (u'ev', 3), (u'business', 3), (u'range', 3), (u'may', 3), (u'typically', 3), (u'resale', 3), (u'show', 2), (u'based', 2), (u'offers', 2), (u'greater', 2), (u'level', 2), (u'evs', 2), (u'enhanced', 2), (u'concern', 2), (u'surplus,', 2), (u'driving', 2), (u'e)', 2), (u'anxiety,', 2), (u'emission', 2), (u'anxiety', 2), (u'profit,', 2), (u'charging', 2), (u'firm\u2019s', 2), (u'paper,', 2), (u'mass', 2), (u'area,', 1), (u'batteries', 1), (u'(i)', 1), (u'find', 1), (u'impact', 1), (u'(o,', 1), (u'improvement', 1), (u'battery', 1), (u'owning/leasing', 1), (u'combinations', 1), (u'using', 1), (u'technology.', 1), (u'yield', 1), (u'bay', 1), (u'yields', 1), (u'them)', 1), (u'referred', 1), (u'(rather', 1), (u'harm', 1), (u'set', 1), (u'often', 1), (u'used', 1), (u'(evs)', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To do this entails the management of a distribution network with more decision options than a traditional retailer. The online retailer, not the customer, decides from where items will ship, by what shipping method, and how or whether multiple-item orders will be broken up into multiple shipments. What is the best way to fulfill each customer’s order to minimize average outbound shipping cost? We partner with an online retailer to examine this question. We develop a heuristic that makes fulfillment decisions by minimizing the immediate outbound shipping cost plus an estimate of future expected outbound shipping costs. These estimates are derived from the dual values of a transportation linear program (LP). In our experiments on industry data, we capture 36% of the opportunity gap assuming clairvoyance, leading to reductions in outbound shipping costs on the order of 1%. These cost savings are achieved without any deterioration in customer service levels or any increase in holding costs. The transportation LP also serves as the basis for a metric that provides information on the quality of the inventory position.

We prove structural properties of the model and show how the optimal parameters of the expediting policy can be computed efficiently. The expediting policy is easy to implement and, for situations with variable expediting cost only, the structure of the policy is optimal. For situations with nonvariable expediting costs, the expediting policy that we consider is generally not optimal. The optimal policy can be computed by dynamic programming, but this approach is computationally feasible only for small-problem instances. We conduct numerical experiments that are based on data from the service division of a global equipment manufacturer to evaluate the performances of the expediting policy and the optimal policy.

Some of these considerations, such as the implications of market arbitrage, can void the relevance of operational models that ignore financial issues. The paper discusses such operational areas where financial activity has significant potential for impact on operations, as well as points where operational considerations provide new perspectives on financial decisions.

Collaboration imposes constraints on the capacity of the process because multitasking resources have to be simultaneously at the right place. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable bottleneck idleness to study the maximal throughput or capacity of such networks. Collaboration and multitasking introduce synchronization requirements that may inflict unavoidable idleness of the bottleneck resources: even when the network is continuously busy (processing at capacity), bottleneck resources can never be fully utilized. The conventional approach that equates network capacity with bottleneck capacity is then incorrect because the network capacity is below that of the bottlenecks. In fact, the gap between the two can grow linearly with the number of collaborative activities. Our main result is that networks with nested collaboration architectures have no unavoidable bottleneck idleness. Then, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, the standard bottleneck procedure correctly identifies the network capacity. We also prove necessity in the sense that, for any nonnested architecture, there are values of processing times for which unavoidable idleness persists. The fundamental trade-off between collaboration and capacity does not disappear in multiserver networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. Yet, even in multiserver networks, a nested collaboration architecture still guarantees that the bottleneck capacity is achievable. Finally, simultaneous collaboration, as a process constraint, may limit the benefits of flexibility.

The hospital administrator decides on the number of wings to form, the number of beds to allocate to each wing, and the set of care types to assign to each wing to maximize the total utility to the hospital. The administrator faces an inherent trade-off between forming large wings to pool demand and bed capacity, and forming specialized wings to focus on narrow ranges of care types. Specialized wings not only provide advantages from focused care but also allow the protection of beds for high-utility care types. We provide an optimization model for the wing formation decision and address the advantages of focus endogenously in our model. Using data from a large urban teaching hospital in the United States along with a national database, we report on a number of managerial insights. In particular, as the overall demand increases across all care types, wings are formed to reserve more beds for higher-utility types, which leads to higher overall hospital utility but also some disparity across types, such as increased hospital access for some and decreased access for others. Furthermore, overall bed occupancy decreases as the hospital is split into wings. However, if sufficient focus is attained, shorter lengths-of-stay associated with focused care may increase overall patient throughput. We also observe that when patients are willing to wait longer for admission, the hospital tends to form more wings.

Specifically, we consider a generalized version of the well-known “selling-to-the-newsvendor” model in which both the upstream and the downstream firms face stochastic input costs. The firms’ operations are intertwined—i.e., the downstream buyer depends on the upstream supplier for delivery and the supplier depends on the buyer for purchase. We show that if left unmanaged, the stochastic costs that reverberate through the supply chain can lead to significant financial losses. The situation could deteriorate to the point of a supply disruption if at least one of the supply chain members cannot profitably make its product. To the extent that hedging can ensure continuation in supply, hedging can have value to at least some of the members of the supply chain. We identify conditions under which the risk of the supply chain breakdown will cause the supply chain members to hedge their input costs: (i) the downstream buyer’s market power exceeds a critical threshold; or (ii) the upstream firm operates on a large margin, there is a high baseline demand for downstream firm’s final product, and the downstream firm’s market power is below a critical threshold. In absence of these conditions there are equilibria in which neither firm hedges. To sustain hedging in equilibrium, both firms must hedge and supply chain breakdown must be costly. The equilibrium hedging policy will (in general) be a partial hedging policy.

Because of the complexity of the diagnostic technology, EID programs are often highly centralized with few laboratories testing blood samples from a large network of health facilities. This leads to long diagnostic delays and consequent failure of patients to collect results in a timely manner. Several point-of-care (POC) devices that provide rapid diagnosis within the health facilities are being developed to mitigate these drawbacks of centralized EID networks. We study the decision of which facilities should receive the POC device (the placement plan) using the EID program in Mozambique as a case study. We argue that the choice of an appropriate plan is critical to maximizing the public health impact of POC devices in the presence of tight budget constraints. To formalize this argument, we develop a detailed simulation model to evaluate the impact of a placement plan. It comprises two parts: an operational model that quantifies the impact of a POC placement plan on the diagnostic delay and a behavioral part that quantifies the impact of diagnostic delay on the likelihood of result collection by infants’ caregivers. We also develop an approximate version of these operational and patient behavior dynamics and embed them in an optimization model to generate candidate POC placement plans. We find that the optimization-based plan can result in up to 30% more patients collecting their results compared to rules of thumb that have practical appeal.

One potential procurement mechanism for such a buyer is to bundle the procurement project with technology acquisition. We propose a dynamic stochastic game-theoretic model that analyzes the optimal technology offer strategies of the asymmetric suppliers and highlights how the size of the current project, relative to the size of the future market, and supplier competition determine the effectiveness of the bundled procurement mechanism for the buyer. For the two-supplier case, we find that each supplier has a dominant technology offer strategy that is independent of the opponent’s strategy. When the relative size of the project is small, suppliers only offer obsolete technologies even if their technologies are perfect substitutes. While suppliers offer better technologies as the project size increases, their responses in technology offers are not continuous with respect to the project size—once the project size reaches some threshold, suppliers’ optimal responses jump to their best technologies.

In particular, the demand process is an integrated moving average process of order (0, 1, 1), for which an exponential-weighted moving average provides the optimal forecast. For the assumed control policy we characterize the inventory random variable and use this to find the safety stock requirements for the system. From this characterization, we see that the required inventory, both in absolute terms and as it depends on the replenishment lead-time, behaves much differently for this case of nonstationary demand compared with stationary demand. We then show how the single-item model extends to a multi-stage, or supply-chain context; in particular we see that the demand process for the upstream stage is not only nonstationary but also more variable than that for the downstream stage.

However, manufacturers must still achieve high product quality in the short run. Hence, short-run quality improvement strategies are necessary, and, if possible, should complement (rather than substitute for) a longer run continuous improvement strategy with suppliers. We propose a novel short-run quality improvement strategy with suppliers which is based on a combinatorial optimization model for determining the optimal matching of raw material batches (from suppliers) with process variable parameters (of the manufacturer) by exploiting their interaction effects. Although the model can be difficult to solve, we develop sufficient conditions for a special case where the attainment of an optimal solution is straightforward. We demonstrate the use of the proposed approach in an actual pharmaceutical process.

It stipulates a maximum percentage revision each element of the period-by-period replenishment schedule is allowed per planning iteration. The supplier is obligated to cover any requests that remain within the upside limits. The bounds on reductions are a form of minimum purchase commitment which discourages the customer from overstating its needs. While QF contracts are being implemented in industrial practice, the academic literature has thus far had little guidance to offer a firm interested in structuring its supply relationships in this way.

Every job (or order) visits all assembly stations in the same sequence and spends the same amount of time (known as the production cycle) at each station. Industries such as aircraft, fire-engine, and automobile assembly have production cycles of a few hours and are labor intensive. In spite of increased automation in such industries, human capital remains the most expensive and important contributor to a flexible production system. In this article we formulate the cross-training problem on a paced assembly line with m stations (mCT). We assume that each worker possesses a number of skills referred to as a skill vector. Our objective is to schedule a set of work orders through the assembly system so as to minimize the size of the required workforce and/or the workforce cross-training costs. We analyze the complexity of mCT and identify polynomially solvable cases. A variety of lower bounds is developed based on optimization techniques. These lower bounds are used to develop a branch and bound algorithm as well as to evaluate our heuristics. A computational experiment reports the performance of all algorithms.

Key assumptions are that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic-review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of strategic safety stock for supply chains that can be modeled as spanning trees. Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories.

Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity.

But little is known about whether inventories have indeed decreased in U.S. manufacturing and whether such a decrease has been restricted to a few well-publicized firms or is true at an industry level. Using data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the authors study trends in materials, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory ratios during the period 1961 to 1994 in 20 manufacturing industry sectors and the total U.S. manufacturing sector to determine whether a significant decrease was seen in these ratios. Further, since a great deal of momentum for inventory reduction began in the early 1980s, the authors investigate whether greater improvement was seen in the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period. We find that material and work-in-process inventories did decrease in a majority of the two-digit industry sectors from 1961 to 1994 and showed greater improvement in about half the sectors in the post-1980 period relative to the pre-1980 period. Finished-goods inventories did decrease in some industry sectors and increase in a few others but did not show a significant trend in more than half the sectors.

In this research we develop a stylized model to analyze the impact of using time guarantees on competition. Demands are assumed to be sensitive to both the price and delivery time guarantees, and the objective of each firm is to select the best price and time guarantee to maximize its operating profit. We first analyze the optimization problem for the individual firms and then study the equilibrium solution in a multiple-firm competition. Using a numerical study, we further illustrate how the different firm and market characteristics would affect the price and delivery time competition in the market. Our results suggest that the equilibrium price and time guarantee decisions in an oligopolistic market with identical firms behave in a similar fashion as the optimal solution in a monopolistic situation from a previous study. However, when there are heterogeneous firms in the market, these firms will exploit their distinctive firm characteristics to differentiate their services.

We consider a Bayesian model of demand in which the unknown mean demand rate is assumed to have a prior, which is a mixture of two normal distributions corresponding to the demand forecast for an innovative (fashion) good. We develop three models of production flexibility: a static model requiring initial placement of both orders, a partially dynamic model requiring a fixing of the time that the second order will be made, and a fully dynamic model with no restrictions on ordering. Supplier flexibility is modeled through supply lead times. We observe that the magnitude of the savings from the static to the fully flexible model, corresponding to the sum of the values of information and production flexibility, reflects all sources of variability: differences between demand means of the prior mixture, variability within each prior, and variability about the observed mean. We observe that as the difference between high and low demand cases increases, the value of information increases, though for long lead times, production flexibility is required to take advantage of the updated information. Further, we observe that the greater the uncertainty within each prior distribution, the greater the value of information relative to the value of production flexibility, particularly for long lead times. However, the greater the uncertainty around the mean demand, which is the uncertainty that cannot be resolved through observation, the lower the value of information.

In fact, CTO has made irrelevant the notion of preconfigured machine types and focuses instead on maintaining the right amount of inventory at the components. CTO appears to be the ideal operational model that provides both mass customization and a quick response time to order fulfillment. To quantify the inventory-service trade-off in the CTO environment, we develop a nonlinear optimization model with multiple constraints, reflecting the service levels offered to different market segments. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an exact algorithm for the important case of demand in each market segment having (at least) one unique component, and a greedy heuristic for the general (nonunique component) case. Furthermore, we show how to use sensitivity analysis, along with simulation, to fine-tune the solutions.

The paper also reviews the research on stochastic optimal control problems associated with manufacturing systems, their dynamic programming equations, existence of solutions of these equations, and verification theorems of optimality for the systems. Manufacturing systems that are addressed include single-machine systems, dynamic flowshops, and dynamic jobshops producing multiple products.

This paper presents a methodology for determining which versions of a set of related components should be offered to optimally support a defined finished product portfolio. We develop optimization models that determine which versions of each component should be introduced and which of these versions each product should use to minimize design and production costs. This approach is appropriate for components with a relatively low impact on consumers’ perceptions about product differentiation, which can be shared across a set of products if they meet the most stringent performance requirements in the set. We illustrate our procedure on automotive braking systems, but also discuss its applicability to other components and industries. We identify three conceptually different organizational approaches to component sharing: a coordinated projects approach that requires higher-level organizational echelons above the individual project, a project-by-project approach that does not, and a hybrid partially coordinated approach. We use our model to examine how the gain from the coordinated projects approach relative to the project-by-project approach varies with the number of component versions in consideration, warranty costs, complexity costs, and demand variability.

Given a marginal value for each product/location, whenever there is a stockout the dispatcher compares the total value of each feasible replenishment with its cost, and chooses one that maximizes the surplus. We derive this operating policy using a linear functional approximation to the optimal value function of a semi-Markov decision process on continuous spaces. This approximation also leads to a math program whose optimal dual prices yield values and whose optimal objective value gives a lower bound on system performance.

The products differ only in their prices and delivery times. We assume that there are dedicated capacities for each product and that there is a standard industry delivery time for the regular (slower) product. The objective of the firm is to determine the delivery time of the express (faster) product and appropriately price the two products, taking into consideration the impact of delivery time reduction on capacity requirements and costs. We develop a model that integrates pricing and delivery time decisions with capacity requirements and costs, and study scenarios where the firm is constrained in capacity for none, one, or both product(s). We show how product differentiation decisions are influenced by capacity costs, and how the firm should adapt its differentiation strategy in response to a change in its operating dynamics. We first identify a market characteristic that governs the optimal pricing structure. We then show that the degree of product differentiation depends on both the absolute, as well as the relative values of the capacity costs. Provided that the capacity cost differential remains the same, higher capacity costs induce less time differentiation and less price differentiation. An increase in capacity cost differential increases price differentiation, but decreases time differentiation. The optimal prices depend, in addition to the above, on the market characteristic.

It is a departure from previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior can be observed in various industries (e.g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. Production of olive oil is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its olives for olive oil production and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total production of olive oil changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies.",636.0,2004,"[(u'oil', 8), (u'olive', 7), (u'yield', 6), (u'olives', 5), (u'production', 4), (u'space', 4), (u'farm', 4), (u'yield.', 3), (u'paper', 3), (u'second', 3), (u'amount', 3), (u'optimal', 3), (u'random', 2), (u'leased', 2), (u'cost', 2), (u'demand.', 2), (u'company', 2), (u'supply.', 2), (u'price', 2), (u'chance', 2), (u'grow', 2), (u'studies', 2), (u'farmers', 2), (u'sale', 2), (u'producer', 1), (u'illustrates', 1), (u'obtain', 1), (u'four', 1), (u'planning', 1), (u'(because', 1), (u'weather,', 1), (u'disease,', 1), (u'previous', 1), (u'industries', 1), (u'decreases', 1), (u'source', 1), (u'(e.g.,', 1), (u'third,', 1), (u'olives.', 1), (u'contributions:', 1), (u'solution.', 1), (u'practice', 1), (u'increases', 1), (u'every', 1), (u'concave', 1), (u'produced,', 1), (u'supplies.', 1), (u'shows', 1), (u'reduced', 1), (u'leasing', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can make it more difficult for the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large fluctuations in supplier production levels from period to period. Using ""stale"" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the fluctuations in production levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the fluctuations in production levels compared to that of using current information.

Acting independently, supply chain partners fail to weigh the cost burden they impose on upstream suppliers when their replenishment order quantities vary from period to period. This paper explores a new approach to coordinate multiple stages in the supply chain by controlling, through appropriate downstream inventory management, the demand variability that is propagated to upstream stages. We propose and analyze a coordinated inventory replenishment policy that uses ""order smoothing"" to reduce order-size variability and thus reduce overall system costs, including both inventory and transportation costs. We characterize the optimal parameter values for smoothing alternatives (such as exponential smoothing and moving weighted average policies), assess their economic benefits, and develop insights regarding supply chain contexts that might benefit most significantly from reducing the variability of orders to upstream stages. Using the distribution network for specialty brand appliances as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the potential cost savings that order-smoothing strategies can yield compared to the uncoordinated case when individual firms separately minimize their costs. The magnitude of savings depends on several factors, including the variability in consumer demand, level of product variety, and degree of inventory aggregation in the distribution system.

Customers have different value-generation potentials whose realizations are observed by the server but not by the manager of the firm. The manager determines a market segmentation scheme given an overall customer value-generation profile, which divides customers into two groups (high and low), and also determines a service level for each segment. The server decides which of the two available service levels (high and low) to provide for each customer, given a compensation scheme offered by the manager. The optimal market segmentation decision, optimal service-level choice, and a set of optimal linear incentive contracts that enable their implementation are characterized.

During peak periods, the energy supplier offers the manufacturing firm—the energy user—an incentive program to reduce its energy usage by shutting down its production facility. Participation in the incentive program, however, is totally voluntary, and the user firm is rewarded for each unit of time that it participates in the program. We consider two problems that face the manufacturing firm. The first is whether it is worth shutting down production to participate in the incentive program when it is offered, and in which part (portion) of the peak period the firm should participate. The second problem is how the firm should decide on its production policy in both the peak and nonpeak periods in the presence of such an incentive program. In this paper, we provide simple models to give insight into the nature of these problems. Two cases are studied. In the first case, the peak duration is assumed to be exponentially distributed, and in the second, its length becomes known at the beginning of a peak period.

Agents find congestion costly and, hence, try to arrive when the system is underutilized. Working in discrete time, we characterize pure-strategy Nash equilibria for the case of ample service capacity. In this case, agents try to spread themselves out as much as possible and their self-interested actions will lead to a socially optimal outcome if all agents have the same well-behaved delay cost function. For even modest sized problems, the set of possible pure-strategy Nash equilibria is quite large, making implementation potentially cumbersome. We consequently examine mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and show that there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. Not only is this equilibrium independent of the number of agents and their individual delay cost functions, the arrival pattern it generates approaches a discrete-time Poisson process as the number of agents and arrival points gets large. Our results extend to the case of time varying preferences. With an appropriate initialization, the results also extend to a system with limited capacity. Our model lends support to the traditional literature on managing service systems. This work has generally ignored customers strategically choosing arrival times.

Even if demand is stationary, managers are held accountable for performance over a finite horizon. In a finite horizon, the fill rate is a random variable. Studying the distribution is relevant because a vendor may be subject to financial penalty if she fails to achieve her target fill rate over a specified finite period. It is known that for a zero lead time, base-stock model, the expected value of a finite-horizon fill rate exceeds the long-run fill rate.

Thus, the agents tend to have different skills, in different combinations. In such an environment, it is challenging to route calls effectively and determine the staff requirements. This paper addresses both of these routing and staffing problems by exploiting limited cross-training. Consistent with the literature on flexible manufacturing, we find that minimal flexibility can provide great benefits: Simulation experiments show that when (1) the service-time distribution does not depend on the call type or the agent and (2) each agent has only two skills, in appropriate combinations, the performance is almost as good as when each agent has all skills. We apply this flexibility property to develop an algorithm for both routing and staffing, aiming to minimize the total staff subject to per-class performance constraints. With appropriate flexibility, it suffices to use a suboptimal routing algorithm.

At the end of the supplier lead time, retailers are given an opportunity to readjust their initial orders (without changing the total order size), so that both retailers can improve their expected costs at the end of respective retailer lead times (the time it takes for items to be shipped from the supplier to the retailers). Because of the possibility of cooperation at the end of supplier lead time, each retailer will consider the other’s order-up-to level in making the ordering decision.

Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives.

Firms usually adopt a price-discrimination policy by offering a trade-in rebate only to the replacement customers to hasten their purchase decisions. Any return flow of products induced by trade-in rebates has the potential to generate revenues through remanufacturing operations. In this paper, we study the optimal pricing/trade-in strategies for such durable, remanufacturable products. We focus on the scenario where the replacement customers are only interested in trade-ins. In this setting, we study three pricing schemes: (i) uniform price for all customers, (ii) age-independent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., constant rebate for replacement customers), and (iii) age-dependent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., age-dependent rebates for replacement customers). We characterize the roles that the durability of the product, the extent of return revenues, the age profile of existing products in the market, and the relative size of the two customer segments play in shaping the optimal prices and the amount of trade-in rebates offered. Throughout the paper we highlight the operational decisions that might influence the above factors, and we support our findings with real-life practices. In an extensive numerical study, we compare the profit potential of different pricing schemes and quantify the reward (penalty) associated with taking into account (ignoring) customer segmentation, the price-discrimination option, return revenues, and the age profile of existing products.

Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market.

In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently.

A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer’s sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early. We characterize the manufacturer’s sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late.

The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience.

First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system’s competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm’s head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified.

Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers’ inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management’s ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.",662.0,2006,"[(u'system', 8), (u'route', 6), (u'retailers', 4), (u'optimal', 4), (u'costs', 4), (u'time', 4), (u'inventory-holding', 3), (u'static', 3), (u'vehicle', 3), (u'n', 3), (u'inventory', 3), (u'decisions', 2), (u'based', 2), (u'policy', 2), (u'customer', 2), (u'every', 2), (u'fixed', 2), (u'route,', 2), (u'routing', 2), (u'retailer', 2), (u'uncertainties', 2), (u'cycle', 2), (u'in-transit', 2), (u'dynamic-routing', 2), (u'i.e.,', 2), (u'examine', 2), (u'travel', 2), (u'=', 2), (u'status', 2), (u'changing', 2), (u'chain', 1), (u'demand', 1), (u'paper', 1), (u'two-level', 1), (u'yet', 1), (u'another,', 1), (u'heuristic', 1), (u'system-replenishment-allocation', 1), (u'cycle.', 1), (u'chosen', 1), (u'distributed', 1), (u'time.', 1), (u'absence', 1), (u'cross-docking', 1), (u'tests', 1), (u'routes.', 1), (u'performance', 1), (u'fully', 1), (u'inventories.', 1), (u'across', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis?

For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to “sell ups,” we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.)

The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices.

In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory. The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy.

For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces to the problem of minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a characterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.",423.0,2008,"[(u'customer', 12), (u'service', 11), (u'satisfaction', 9), (u'customers', 5), (u'blame', 5), (u'delays', 4), (u'routine', 4), (u'attributions', 4), (u'role', 4), (u'failures', 4), (u'research', 3), (u'flights', 3), (u'employee', 3), (u'interactions', 3), (u'external', 3), (u'lower', 3), (u'components', 3), (u'find', 2), (u'effects', 2), (u'origin,', 2), (u'level', 2), (u'satisfaction.', 2), (u'assign', 2), (u'key', 2), (u'failures.', 2), (u'flight', 2), (u'failures,', 2), (u'delayed', 2), (u'internal', 2), (u'specifically,', 2), (u'operations', 1), (u'paper', 1), (u'hypothesize', 1), (u'setting', 1), (u'extends', 1), (u'samples', 1), (u'take', 1), (u'employee-customer', 1), (u'affected', 1), (u'greater', 1), (u'provider', 1), (u'overall', 1), (u'matters', 1), (u'hypothesizing', 1), (u'quasi-experimental', 1), (u'affect', 1), (u'difference', 1), (u'origin.', 1), (u'investigate', 1), (u'either', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information).

In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels.

The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).",505.0,2009,"[(u'search', 6), (u'transfer', 6), (u'rds', 5), (u'pricing', 4), (u'scheme', 4), (u'demand', 4), (u'price', 4), (u'retailers', 3), (u'manufacturer', 3), (u'system', 3), (u'cds', 2), (u'customers', 2), (u'prefer', 2), (u'unmet', 2), (u'either', 2), (u'unsatisfied', 2), (u'design', 2), (u'excess', 2), (u'retailer', 2), (u'parties', 2), (u'party', 2), (u'stock', 2), (u'product', 2), (u'rds.', 2), (u'may', 2), (u'lower', 2), (u'transshipment', 1), (u'phenomenon', 1), (u'random', 1), (u'multilocation', 1), (u'demand,', 1), (u'thus,', 1), (u'find', 1), (u'impact', 1), (u'favor', 1), (u'(cds),', 1), (u'course,', 1), (u'overstocked.', 1), (u'rebalanced', 1), (u'location', 1), (u'endogenous', 1), (u'available,', 1), (u'demands', 1), (u'schedules', 1), (u'using', 1), (u'one', 1), (u'level', 1), (u'method', 1), (u'benefit', 1), (u'fixed', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored.

Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem.

We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality.

This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it.

This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies.

A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high.

DMEP combines dual-source (i.e., a less-expensive-but-slower base mode and a faster-but-more-expensive flexible mode) procurement with option contracts in three layers: a contract negotiation layer, where the firm chooses the best combination of lead time and price for each mode from the supply contract menu; a capacity reservation layer, where the firm reserves total equipment procurement quantities from the two supply modes before the planning horizon starts; and an execution layer, where the firm orders equipment from the two supply modes based on the updated demand information. We first investigate the execution layer as a dynamic dual-source capacity expansion problem with demand backlogging and demonstrate that the optimal policy lacks structure even under the simplest setting. Thus, we propose a heuristic solution for the execution-layer problem, which also serves as a building block for the other two layers.

This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model).

Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U.S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels.

This decision is complicated when servers must be equitably—as well as efficiently—dispatched to customers. In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival.

In this paper, we consider a facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments.

Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability.

The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers.

This simplification is helpful because the stochastic model becomes much more tractable. Offered load analysis can be especially helpful when the demand is not only uncertain but also time varying, as in many service systems.

The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure.

In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level.

That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times.

We view products as collections of components linked together to work as an integrated whole. Previous work has established modularity (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and cyclicality (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components).

Second, the work conserving cμ priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A strategic delay policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies.

However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers.

In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty.

We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization.

Next, new business models can be identified by changing the context of the decision associated with the most consequential of these inefficiencies. We conjecture that four elements of the decision context are most significant: WHAT decisions are made, WHEN they are made, WHO makes them, and WHY they are made.

Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level.

Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon.

Variability in those prices has implications for how much a manufacturer should invest in three fundamental types of process improvement. Input price variability reduces the value of improving input efficiency (output produced per unit input) but increases that of capacity efficiency (the rate at which a production facility can convert input into output). Output price variability increases the value of capacity efficiency, but it increases the value of input efficiency if and only if the expected margin is small. Moreover, as the expected input cost rises, the value of input efficiency decreases. A third type of process improvement is to develop flexibility in input efficiency versus capacity efficiency (the ability to respond to a rise in input cost or fall in output price by increasing input-efficiency at the expense of capacity efficiency). The value of this flexibility decreases with variability in input and output prices if and only if the expected margin is thin.

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation.

Assuming that the NHPP has a rate that can be regarded as approximately piecewise-constant, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistical test of a Poisson process (PP) can be applied to test for a NHPP by combining data from separate subintervals, exploiting the classical conditional-uniform property. In this paper, we apply KS tests to banking call center and hospital emergency department arrival data and show that they are consistent with the NHPP property, but only if that data is analyzed carefully.

Kidney exchange is an important type of barter exchange market that allows incompatible patient–donor pairs to exchange kidneys so the involved patients can receive a transplant. The clearing problem is to find an allocation of donors to patients that is optimal with respect to multiple criteria. To achieve the best possible score on all criteria, long cycles and chains are often needed, particularly when there are many hard-to-match patients.

Both production and transportation times are stochastic with general distributions. Demand arrives at each DC according to an independent Poisson process and is backlogged if the DC is out of stock. We allow different holding and backlog costs at the different DCs. We assume that inventory at DCs is managed using the one-for-one replenishment policy. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the control of the multiechelon M/G/1 setting with general transportation times. To achieve this objective, we analyze several decentralized allocation policies including the first-come, first-served (FCFS), strict priority (SP), and multilevel rationing (MR) policies. For our analytic results, we assume no order crossing. We derive the cost function for a capacitated two-echelon inventory system with general transportation times under these policies. Our numerical examples show that the FCFS policy may outperform the MR policy, even though the latter has been shown to be better in the centralized setting. This suggests that in decentralized settings there is a need to focus on policies that prioritize customers when there is backlog. This focus is in contrast to the centralized settings, where inventory rationing policies that focus on prioritization when there is available inventory are effective. We therefore introduce and analyze the generalized multilevel rationing (GMR) priority policy. We compare the GMR policy with other policies and show that the GMR policy outperforms the three policies used in the centralized setting. We also compare the GMR policy with the myopic (T), longest queue first (LQF), and the optimal (when order crossing is allowed during the transportation time) policies.

From an implementation perspective, it is desirable to design a simple policy like a base-stock list-price (BSLP) policy. The existing research on this problem often imposes restrictive conditions to ensure the optimality of a BSLP policy, which limits its applicability in practice. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic inventory and pricing control problem in which the demand follows a generalized additive model (GAM). The GAM overcomes the limitations of several demand models commonly used in the literature, but introduces analytical challenges in analyzing the dynamic program. Via a variable transformation approach, we identify a new set of technical conditions under which a BSLP policy is optimal. These conditions are easy to verify because they depend only on the location and scale parameters of demand as functions of price and are independent of the cost parameters or the distribution of the random demand component. Moreover, although a BSLP policy is optimal under these conditions, the optimal price may not be monotone decreasing in the inventory level. We further demonstrate our results by applying a constrained maximum likelihood estimation procedure to simultaneously estimate the demand function and verify the optimality of a BSLP policy on a retail data set.",1143.0,2013,"[(u'demand', 5), (u'policy', 4), (u'bslp', 4), (u'dynamic', 3), (u'conditions', 3), (u'parameters', 2), (u'pricing', 2), (u'research', 2), (u'optimality', 2), (u'problem', 2), (u'verify', 2), (u'inventory', 2), (u'optimal', 2), (u'price', 2), (u'operations', 1), (u'random', 1), (u'desirable', 1), (u'results', 1), (u'existing', 1), (u'policy,', 1), (u'policy.', 1), (u'identify', 1), (u'depend', 1), (u'implementation', 1), (u'considerable', 1), (u'location', 1), (u'easy', 1), (u'transformation', 1), (u'generalized', 1), (u'practice', 1), (u'(gam).', 1), (u'overcomes', 1), (u'follows', 1), (u'imposes', 1), (u'common', 1), (u'analytical', 1), (u'become', 1), (u'set', 1), (u'often', 1), (u'challenges', 1), (u'list-price', 1), (u'cost', 1), (u'design', 1), (u'optimal.', 1), (u'scale', 1), (u'new', 1), (u'limitations', 1), (u'simultaneously', 1), (u'monotone', 1), (u'attention', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Working faster may result in greater output and less delay, but may result in lower quality and dissatisfied customers. In this work, we consider dynamic models in a monopoly setting to explore the optimal balance among the multiple dimensions of speed, price, and wait time. The impact of quality is captured via the market demand potential, which is a function of the speed (quality) in the previous period. We obtain several results and insights. First, in scenarios where speed may be difficult to change over time (e.g., some automated production lines) but price can be changed, we show that the optimal price charged is such that the demand rate remains constant over time, even though the price and market potential are changing. Furthermore, we identify conditions when the firm will work at a speed that is higher or lower than a benchmark speed and characterize the behavior of prices over time. Second, in scenarios where a firm may not be able to change prices but can adjust the speed each period, the firm starts at a speed that may be faster or slower than a benchmark speed but converges to it over time. In this constant price case, as the benchmark speed increases, the initial speed adopted by the firm is actually lower but increases more quickly thereafter. We also characterize the behavior of price and speed in settings where both can be changed over time. Interestingly, a firm typically starts at a slow speed and increases the speed, price, and demand over time.

Although the severity of influenza pandemics vary, evidence suggests that an efficient and rapid response is crucial for mitigating morbidity, mortality, and costs to society. Hence, preparing for a potential influenza pandemic is a high priority of governments at all levels (local, state, federal), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and companies. In a severe pandemic, when a large number of people are ill, infected persons and their families may have difficulty purchasing and preparing meals. Various government agencies and NGOs plan to provide meals to these households. In this paper, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, we study food distribution planning during an influenza pandemic. We develop a disease spread model to estimate the spread pattern of the disease geographically and over time, combine it with a facility location and resource allocation network model for food distribution, and develop heuristics to find near-optimal solutions for large instances. We run our combined disease spread and facility location model for the state of Georgia and present the estimated number of infections and the number of meals needed in each census tract for a one-year period along with a design of the supply chain network.

We consider a class of appointment planning problems that involve two sets of decisions: job sequencing, i.e., determining the order in which a list of jobs should be performed by the server, and appointment scheduling, i.e., planning the starting times for jobs. These decisions are interconnected because their joint goal is to minimize the expected server idle time and job late-start penalty costs incurred because of randomness in job durations. In this paper, we design new heuristics for sequencing appointments. The idea behind the development of these heuristics is the structural connection between such appointment scheduling problems and stochastic inventory control in serial supply chains. In particular, the decision of determining time allowances as buffers against random job durations is analogous to that of selecting inventory levels as buffers to accommodate random demand in a supply chain; having excess buffers in appointment scheduling and supply chain settings incurs idle time and excess inventory holding costs, respectively, and having inadequate buffers leads to delays of subsequent jobs and backorders, respectively. Recognizing this connection, we propose tractable approximations for the job sequencing problem, obtain several insights, and further develop a very simple sequencing rule of ordering jobs by duration variance to late-start penalty cost ratio.

Erlang-R accommodates customers who return to service several times during their sojourn within the system, and its modeling power is most pronounced in time-varying environments. Indeed, it was motivated by healthcare systems, in which offered-loads vary over time and patients often go through a repetitive service process. Erlang-R helps answer questions such as how many servers (physicians/nurses) are required to achieve predetermined service levels. Formally, it is merely a two-station open queueing network, which, in a steady state, evolves like an Erlang-C (M/M/s) model. In time-varying environments, on the other hand, the situation differs: here one must account for the reentrant nature of service to avoid excessive staffing costs or undesirable service levels. We validate Erlang-R against an emergency ward (EW) operating under normal conditions as well as during a mass casualty event (MCE). In both scenarios, we apply time-varying fluid and diffusion approximations: the EW is critically loaded and the MCE is overloaded.

Such problems are faced by many companies in practice, and they are very difficult because of the potential unlimited possible configurations of the bundle and the correlations among the individual products. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down and bottom-up approach to solve this problem. In the top-down step, we decompose the bundle into each component and calibrate a value score for each component. In the bottom-up step, we aggregate the components back to the bundle, define important features of the bundle, and segment different RFQs by those bundle features as well as customer attributes. Then we estimate a utility function for each segment based on historical sales data and derive an optimal price for each incoming RFQ.

A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice.

First, data mining and statistical analysis was performed using a large data set to identify categories of surgeries that could be grouped together based on surgical time distributions and could be categorized at the time of case scheduling. These surgical categories are then used in a hierarchical optimization approach with the objective of maximizing a weighted combination of OR utilization and net profit. The optimization model is explored to consider trade-offs and relationships among utilization levels, financial performance, overtime allowance, and case mix. The new scheduling approach was implemented via a custom Web-based application that allowed the surgeons and schedulers to interactively identify best surgical days with patients. A pilot implementation resulted in a utilization increase of 19% and a reduction in overtime by 10%.",630.0,2015,"[(u'surgical', 4), (u'surgeries', 4), (u'utilization', 4), (u'approach', 3), (u'overtime', 3), (u'scheduling', 3), (u'time', 3), (u'identify', 2), (u'categories', 2), (u'spine', 2), (u'resulted', 2), (u'case', 2), (u'optimization', 2), (u'data', 2), (u'consider', 1), (u'paper', 1), (u'statistical', 1), (u'decisions', 1), (u'relationships', 1), (u'based', 1), (u'application', 1), (u'implementation', 1), (u'surgeons', 1), (u'4', 1), (u'allowance,', 1), (u'combination', 1), (u'mayo', 1), (u'using', 1), (u'discuss', 1), (u'teams', 1), (u'large', 1), (u'planning', 1), (u'lasting', 1), (u'set', 1), (u'financial', 1), (u'trade-offs', 1), (u'driving', 1), (u'levels,', 1), (u'19%', 1), (u'implemented', 1), (u'best', 1), (u'web-based', 1), (u'schedulers', 1), (u'preferences', 1), (u'(mean', 1), (u'tend', 1), (u'increase', 1), (u'weighted', 1), (u'new', 1), (u'net', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We show the treatment reduces by half the number of customers who churn from the service during the first week. Further, treated customers ask 19.55% fewer questions during the first week of their tenure than the controls. Although the treatment’s effects decay within one week, we show that such proactive customer education can have significant economic benefits for the provider.

This paper is motivated by ones in which a supplier sells its primary product to a buyer that incurs an emissions cost (voluntarily, or due to government-imposed climate policy) and sells co-products into markets without emissions costs. Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier’s emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost.

The general premise behind these works is that such models may be used to help manage an ED that consistently faces high congestion. In this work, we propose a class of proactive policies that utilize future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get “too bad.” We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice.

We study how consumers’ discount-seeking purchase deferrals affect online retailers’ return policy choices. Lenient returns may induce higher full-price sales by limiting consumer regret, while signaling clearance unavailability risk. Contrasting earlier research that concluded a monopolist must set the refund at the clearance price when strategic consumers were overlooked, we find that an optimal refund bounded by the clearance price can mitigate purchase deferrals only when a monopolist salvages at mild discounts. To explore conditions under which a monopolist permits “full-refund returns,” we consider three scenarios: we permit clearing inventory without a loss; we assume lenient returns stimulate aggregate demand; we consider consumers’ transaction costs. We also derive a unique rational expectations equilibrium for competing retailers, wherein each retailer’s equilibrium refund is nondecreasing in its clearance price. Furthermore, retailers with clearance prices below a threshold should not allow returns, and those who do, higher clearance revenues imply higher full prices, higher quantities, and higher profits.

In this paper, motivated by the influenza vaccine industry, we study a supply chain contracting problem in the presence of uncertainties surrounding design, delivery, and demand of the influenza vaccine. In this supply chain, a manufacturer has insufficient incentive to initiate at-risk early production prior to the design freeze because it is a retailer who reaps the most benefits from selling more vaccines delivered on time. Anticipating that late delivery will lead to potential loss in demand, the retailer tends to reduce the order size, which further discourages the manufacturer from making an effort to improve its delivery performance. To break this negative feedback loop, a supply contract needs to achieve two objectives: incentivize at-risk early production and eliminate double marginalization. We find that two commonly observed supply contracts in practice, the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility (D-QF) contract and the late-rebate (LR) contract, may fail to coordinate the supply chain because of the tension between these two objectives. To resolve such a tension, we construct a buyback-and-late-rebate (BLR) contract and show that a properly designed BLR contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also can provide full flexibility of profit division between members of the supply chain.

We utilize a discrete-time model in which the inventory level is chosen before the start of a finite rental season, and customers not immediately served are lost. Demand, rental durations, and rental unit lifetimes are stochastic; sample path coupling allows us to derive structural results that hold under limited distributional assumptions. Considering different “recirculation” rules (i.e., which unit to select to meet a demand), we prove the concavity of the expected profit function and identify the optimal recirculation rule under two different models of a rental unit’s state: the number of times rented out or its condition. We develop two upper bounds on the number of lost rental units and two heuristics for the inventory decision. Numerical study shows the following: (1) accounting for rental unit loss can increase the expected profit by 7% for a single season; (2) the optimal inventory level in response to increasing loss probability is nonmonotonic; (3) both heuristics perform well; and (4) choosing the optimal recirculation rule over a commonly used policy can increase the profit-maximizing service level by up to six percentage points.",506.0,2016,"[(u'rental', 8), (u'inventory', 4), (u'loss', 3), (u'level', 3), (u'unit', 3), (u'optimal', 3), (u'two', 3), (u'heuristics', 2), (u'profit', 2), (u'increase', 2), (u'number', 2), (u'expected', 2), (u'study', 2), (u'different', 2), (u'recirculation', 2), (u'rule', 2), (u'limited', 1), (u'random', 1), (u'results', 1), (u'utilize', 1), (u'identify', 1), (u'innovative', 1), (u'demand,', 1), (u'derive', 1), (u'chosen', 1), (u'durations,', 1), (u'policy', 1), (u'(1)', 1), (u'decision.', 1), (u'customers', 1), (u'motivated', 1), (u'rules', 1), (u'nonmonotonic;', 1), (u'immediately', 1), (u'structural', 1), (u'lost', 1), (u'served', 1), (u'upper', 1), (u'models,', 1), (u'lifetimes', 1), (u'choosing', 1), (u'following:', 1), (u'increasing', 1), (u'shows', 1), (u'considering', 1), (u'business', 1), (u'\u201crecirculation\u201d', 1), (u'path', 1), (u'discrete-time', 1), (u'condition.', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We first examine the guaranteed-service model for a capacitated single-stage system with bounded demand. We characterize the optimal inventory policy, which depends on the entire demand history. Due to this complexity, we develop a heuristic, namely a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering. This is an order-up-to policy but with its replenishment orders censored by the capacity constraint. We refer to this heuristic as the modified constant base-stock policy (MCBS). We use a numerical experiment to compare the performance of the heuristic policy to the optimal policy. We find that the performance of the heuristic relative to the optimal policy improves with a tighter capacity constraint. We also observe that the performance of the heuristic itself can sometimes be improved by tightening the capacity constraint. We then use the results for a single-stage system to model a multistage serial system that operates with a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering, i.e., an MCBS policy. We show how to adapt the existing dynamic programming algorithm for the unconstrained case to solve for the safety-stock locations and base-stock levels in a capacitated serial system. We describe how to extend this model to other supply chain topologies.

In addition, we examine the differential implications of these mechanisms on the financial performance of HIT and LIT retailers.

The problem is to select steel coils from a set of waiting coils to form batches to be annealed in available batch annealing furnaces and choose a median coil for each furnace. The objective is to maximize the total reward of the selected coils less the total coil–coil and coil–furnace mismatching cost. For a special case of the problem that arises frequently in practical settings where the coils are all similar and there is only one type of furnace available, we develop a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. For the general case of the problem, which is strongly NP-hard, an exact branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm is developed using a column and row generation framework. A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm. The algorithm is capable of solving medium-size instances to optimality within a reasonable computation time. In addition, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for solving larger instances. Three simple search neighborhoods, as well as a sophisticated variable-depth neighborhood, are developed. This heuristic can generate near-optimal solutions for large instances within a short computation time. Using both randomly generated and real-world production data sets, we show that our algorithms are superior to the typical rule-based planning approach used by many steel plants. A decision support system that embeds our algorithms was developed and implemented at Baosteel to replace their rule-based planning method.

We use event-based dynamic programming to build a framework for modeling different kinds of these facilities. This framework contains a number of service priority policies that are concerned with prioritizing screening versus diagnostic services. The main trade-off is between serving urgent diagnostic needs and providing screening services that may decrease future diagnostic needs. Under certain conditions, this trade-off reverses the famous cμ rule; i.e., the patients with lower waiting cost are given priority over the others.

In this research, we develop a novel scheduling formulation that explicitly considers the uncertainty in elective operation durations and also plans for potential randomly arriving urgent demands. Using a scenario-based modeling approach, the objective of this formulation is to maximize the expected profit associated with the OT schedule.

How can buyers motivate suppliers to exert greater care to prevent such harm? This paper characterizes a “backfiring condition” under which actions taken by prominent buyers (increasing auditing, publicizing negative audit reports, providing loans to suppliers) motivate a supplier to exert greater effort to pass the buyer’s audit by hiding information and less care to prevent harm. Intuitively appealing actions for a buyer (penalizing a supplier for harming workers or the environment, or for trying to deceive an auditor) may be similarly counterproductive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, squeezing a supplier’s margin (by reducing the price paid to the supplier or increasing wages for workers) motivates the supplier to exert greater care to prevent harm—under the backfiring condition. Whereas the necessary and sufficient condition depends on the relative convexity of the supplier’s hiding cost function, a simple sufficient condition is that the supplier is likely to successfully hide information from the auditor, in equilibrium.

To build supply chain capabilities, organizations face a choice between two fundamentally different sourcing strategies—reactive capacity and safety stock. We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time—a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems.

Refurbishing to remarket or to fulfill warranty claims are the two common disposition options considered to unlock the value in consumer returns, which present the OEM with a challenging problem: How should an OEM dynamically allocate consumer returns between fulfilling warranty claims and remarketing refurbished products over the product’s life cycle? We analyze this dynamic allocation problem and find that when warranty claims and consumer returns are jointly taken into account, the remarketing option is generally dominated by the option of refurbishing and earmarking consumer returns to fulfill warranty claims. Over the product’s life cycle, the OEM should strategically emphasize earmarking of consumer returns at the early stages of the life cycle to build up earmarked inventory for the future warranty demand, whereas it should consider remarketing at the later stages of the life cycle after enough earmarked inventory is accumulated or most of the warranty demand uncertainty is resolved. These findings show that, for product categories with significant warranty coverage and refund costs, remarketing may not be the most profitable disposition option even if the product has strong remarketing potential and the OEM has the pricing leverage to tap into this market. We also show that the optimal dynamic disposition policy is a price-dependent base-stock policy where the earmarked quantity is capacitated by the new and refurbished product sales quantities.

While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures.

However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs).

It describes how demand variance amplifies from a downstream site to an upstream site due to demand information distortion. Two different bullwhip effect measures have been used in the literature. Theorists analyze the bullwhip effect based on the information flow (i.e., order and demand information), whereas most empiricists measure it according to the material flow (i.e., shipment and sales data). It is unclear how much the discrepancy between these two measures is, and, if significant, how to reconcile the discrepancy. In this paper, we illustrate and quantify the discrepancy under three inventory systems. For the system with stationary demand and ample supply, we show that the bullwhip effect measure based on the material-flow data is always greater than that based on the information flow. For the system with correlated demand and for the system with supply shortages, we derive conditions under which the material flow measure is either greater or less than the information flow measure. We find that the discrepancy is driven by four factors: stocking level, lead time, demand correlation, and supply service level.

Information resolves two types of uncertainty: product value uncertainty (i.e., consumers realize valuations when they inspect the product in store, but may end up returning the product when they purchase online) and availability uncertainty (i.e., store visits are futile when consumers encounter stockouts). We consider three information mechanisms: physical showrooms allow consumers to learn valuations anytime they visit the store, even during stockouts; virtual showrooms give consumers online access to an imperfect signal of their valuations; availability information provides real-time information about whether the store has a product in stock. Our main results follow. First, physical showrooms may prompt retailers to reduce store inventory, which increases availability risk and discourages store patronage.

Although the leader and the follower cooperate in their component purchase, they compete in selling their end products. We first analyze the most common and simple form of LCB, equal price LCB, under which the follower pays to the leader the same wholesale price that the leader obtains from his negotiation with the supplier. We compare each buyer’s profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader’s and follower’s products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier. We show that fixed price LCB benefits not only the leader but also the follower, compared with separate purchases, which implies that fixed price LCB always achieves a win–win outcome for the buyers.

Inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized, whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized.

We aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators’ (in)flexibility and renewable energy’s intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system.

We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician’s decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists.

The market size in each period is random, following a stationary distribution. Consumers are loss averse with stochastic reference points that represent their beliefs about possible price and product availability. Given the distribution of reference points, they choose purchase plans to maximize their expected total utility, including gain-loss utility, before visiting the store, and follow the plans in the store. In anticipation of consumers purchase plans, in each period, before demand uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses an initial order quantity. After the uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses a contingent price depending on the demand realization, with the option of clearing inventory by charging a sale price, and otherwise, posting a full price. Over repeated periods, the interaction of the firm’s operational decisions about ordering and contingent pricing and the consumers purchase actions results in a distribution of reference points, and, in equilibrium, this distribution is consistent with consumers beliefs. Under this framework of endogenized reference points, we fully characterize the firm’s optimal inventory and contingent pricing policies. We identify conditions under which the firm’s expected price and profit are increasing in the consumer loss aversion level. We also show that the firm can prefer demand variability over no-demand uncertainty.

The sales forces compensation package affects how the salespeople are going to exert their effort, which in turn determines the sales pattern for the firms product and ultimately drives the performance of the firms production and inventory system. In general, a smooth demand process facilitates production/inventory planning. Therefore, it is beneficial for a firm to induce its salespeople to exert effort in a way that actually smoothes the demand process.

Hence, time and quality are substitutes, a feature that we recognize explicitly in our definition of the firms capacity. Production yields are not exogenous parameters but endogenously determined by workers responding to schedule pressures. The plant manager can authorize overtime to relieve this pressure or live with the quality consequences of rushing. The model reveals the close relationships among the firms workforce policies, the integrity of the inspection system, and the cost performance of the firmas its volume and/or product line expands. We consider pure congestion (driven by volume) and pure complexity (driven by product line breadth) effects in the context of our plant performance model. We consider two root causes of complexity costs: time and quality. The time effects of complexity will only have cost consequences in congested facilities, but quality effects are always present.

Our contribution is to allow new relationships between the valuations of the two products by potential customers, and to allow differing unit production costs. We identify equilibrium results when two competing firms each offer one product, and find the profit maximizing result when one (monopolistic) firm offers both products.

A firms new product success depends on its ability to manage the product development process in a way that employs scarce resources to achieve the goal of the firm as well as the specific projects objectives. Simple and measurable performance metrics have been proposed and applied to monitor and compensate the development teams. In this paper, we develop a modeling frame work to analyze the implications of setting managerial priorities for three commonly used new product performance metrics: (1) time-to-market, (2) product performance, and (3) total development cost. We model new product development as a “product performance production” process that requires scarce development resources. Setting a target for development teams for each of these performance metrics can constrain this performance production process and, thereby, affect the other performance metrics. We model the constrained process as a restricted case of a general process that does not have such constraints. We benchmark each constrained process against the optimal, unrestricted process with respect to the level of the resource intensity employed during the development process, the time-to-market, and the performance level of the new product at launch. We show that an overly ambitious time-to-market target leads to an upward bias in resource intensity usage and a downward bias in product performance (i.e., evolutionary product innovation). In addition, our results suggest that the target time-to-market approach may ignore the effect of cannibalization and, thus, can perform suboptimally if a significant degree of cannibalization in the existing product market is expected. Given a target product performance, we show that the coordination between marketing and R&D is easier because the resulting development resource intensity and time-to-market decisions becomes separable. However, an overly ambitious product performance target leads to an upward bias in the development resource intensity and a delayed product launch that misses the window of opportunity. Finally, we show that the target development cost approach can lead a downward bias in product performance and a premature product launch.

The demand itself evolves according to an auto-regressive time series. We examine three types of supply chain configurations. In the first setting, the retailer and the supplier coordinate their policy parameters in an attempt to minimize systemwide costs, but they do not share their observations of market signals.

In a large organization production and marketing are traditionally measured in terms of performance criteria appropriate and relevant within the world in which they operate, rather than in terms of overall company performance. We consider a situation where the headquarters uses a simple linear transfer price between the two functions to govern the transactions. The misaligned incentives among these functional managers are caused by a transfer price between them that distorts the marginal production cost and revenue, as well as by a misallocation of cost: Marketings pricing strategy influences expected leftover inventory, but only production incurs the cost. The misalignment can be mitigated through the following two ways. First, if production commits to a service level instead of an inventory level, both production and marketing, and hence the firm as a whole, are better off.

We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of Cachon and Lariviere (2001).

The study of the cells production technology provides us with insights that are potentially useful in industrial manufacturing. When comparing cell metabolism with manufacturing techniques in industry, we find some striking commonalities, but also some important differences. Like todays well-run factories, the cell operates a very lean production system, assures quality at the source, and uses component commonality to simplify production. While we can certainly learn from how the cell accomplishes these parallels, it is even more interesting to look at how the cell operates differently. In biological cells, all products and machines are built from a small set of common building blocks that circulate in local recycling loops. Production equipment is added, removed, or renewed instantly when needed. The cells manufacturing unit is highly autonomous and reacts quickly to a wide range of changes in the local environment.

The model is an M/M/1 queue with homogeneous patients and exponential reneging. Patients join the waiting system and organ transplants are reflected by the service process. In addition, unlike the standard M/M/1 model, each service instance is associated with a variable reward that reflects the quality of the transplant organ, and patients have the option to refuse an organ (service) offer if they expect future offers to be better. Under an assumption of perfect and complete information, it is demonstrated that the queueing discipline is a potent instrument that can be used to maximize social welfare. In particular, first-come-first-serve (FCFS) amplifies patients desire to refuse offers of marginal quality, and generates excessive organ wastage. By contrast, last-come-first-serve (LCFS) contains the inefficiencies engendered by patient choice and achieves optimal organ utilization.

This parallel leads to a reinterpretation of the dynamic pricing problem as a price-setting newsvendor problem with recourse, which is useful not only because it yields insights into the optimal solution, but also because it leads to additional insights into how pricing recourse affects the actions and profits of a price-setting newsvendor. We make contributions in three areas: First, we develop structural properties that define an optimal pricing strategy over a finite horizon and investigate how that policy impacts a newsvendors optimal procurement policy and optimal expected profit.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a sellers pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers strategic behavior, we derive the sellers optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the sellers forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the sellers forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty.

The best-known example is the FASTPASS® system at Disneyland. To operate such a system, the service provider must make an upfront decision on how to allocate service capacity between the two lines. Then, during system operation, he must provide estimates of the waiting times for both lines to each arriving customer. The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality.

For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling—i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders—is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%–65% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling.

Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers purchasing behavior, a sellers pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the sellers profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the sellers and the consumers payoffs is possible.

The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function.

This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price.

For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitors inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics.

We solve for the buyers optimal procurement contract. We show that the optimal contract can be interpreted as the buyer choosing between diversification and competition benefits. Better information increases diversification benefits and decreases competition benefits. Therefore, with better information the buyer is more inclined to diversify. Moreover, better information may increase or decrease the value of the dual-sourcing option, depending on the buyers unit revenue: for large revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for diversification, the benefits of which increase with information; for small revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for competition, the benefits of which decrease with information. Surprisingly, as the reliability of the entire supply base decreases, the buyer may stop diversifying under asymmetric information (to leverage competition), whereas it would never do so under symmetric information. Finally, we analyze the effect of codependence between supply disruptions. We find that lower codependence leads the buyer to rely less on competition.

Although customers value reservations, restaurants typically neither charge for them nor impose penalties for failing to keep them. However, reservations impose costs on firms offering them. We offer a novel motivation for offering reservations that emphasizes the way in which reservations can alter customer behavior. We focus on a market in which demand is uncertain and the firm has limited capacity. There is a positive chance that the firm will not have enough capacity to serve all potential customers. Customers are unable to observe how many potential diners are in the market before incurring a cost to request service. Hence, if reservations are not offered, some may choose to stay home rather than risk being denied service. This lowers the firms sales when realized demand is low. Reservations increase sales on a slow night by guaranteeing reservations holders service. However, some reservation holders may choose not to use their reservations resulting in no-shows.

The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributors expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered.

We show that the inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, whereas the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, we identify four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyers liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product.

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the resellers inventory holding cost. When the resellers inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the resellers order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the resellers inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the resellers performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the resellers cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of resellers inventory holding cost and suppliers cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce resellers gray market diversion through an all-unit discount.

The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firms cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal.

IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under α-contracts, a fixed fraction α of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity. Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity. Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDMs expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection.

By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the sellers ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the sellers profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers strategic waiting is to offer price guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the sellers profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season.

This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firms development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firms development and introduction decisions and considering the products environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement.

Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry and the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGOs activism.

In our experiment, subjects assigned the role of buyers made purchase decisions in response to prices set by an automated seller. We find that equilibrium predictions assuming fully strategic buyers largely accounted for aggregate behavior in the experiment, and the ex post optimal decisions for subjects were overwhelmingly consistent with equilibrium prescriptions. Moreover, subjects tended to become individually more strategic as the session progressed. However, there were also nuanced systematic patterns of deviations from equilibrium that had profit and pricing implications for the seller. First, a nonnegligible minority of subjects exhibited completely myopic buying behavior even with practice.

The client firm usually requires strict confidentiality that forbids the consultant to make any disclosure about the information acquisition, believing that greater informational advantage will surely be to its own benefits. As a result, neither the information content nor the information status is known to any third party. But should the firm always care so much about strict confidentiality? Will it be beneficial if the firms information status, but not the information content, is known to its partners or any other firms? We investigate this issue in the context of a two-tier supply chain. A manufacturer offers a menu of contracts for supplying a product to a retailer who sells it in a market with random demand that has a known continuous distribution. The retailer hires a consultant to acquire demand information, with uncertain outcome. With probability t, the retailer becomes informed about the market demand, and with probability 1 − t, he remains uninformed, where the probability t can be regarded as representing the retailers information acquisition capability.

The demand captured by a firm depends on the gap between the firms offer and the benchmark. We refer to the benchmark effect as the impact of this gap on demand. The formation of the benchmark is endogenous and depends on both firms choices. When the benchmark is equal to the shorter of the two offered delays, we characterize the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a stickiness effect in which firms equate their delays at the equilibrium when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. When the benchmark corresponds to a weighted average of the two offered delays, we show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. In this case, we reveal a reversal effect, in which the market leader, i.e., the firm that offers a shorter delay, becomes the follower when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. In both cases, we show that customers equilibrium waiting times are shorter with the benchmark effect than without it. Our models also capture customers loss aversion, which, in our setting, states that demand is more sensitive to the gap between the delay and the benchmark when the delay is longer than the benchmark (loss) than when it is shorter (gain).

Capacity for the new product can be acquired both by purchasing new production lines and by converting existing production lines for the old product. Furthermore, in either case, the new product capacity is “retrofitted” to be flexible, i.e., to be able to also produce the old product. This capacity planning problem arises regularly at Intel, which served as the motivating context for this research. We formulate a two-product capacity planning model to determine the equipment purchase and conversion schedule, considering (i) time-varying and uncertain demand, (ii) dedicated and flexible capacity, (iii) inventory and equipment costs, and (iv) a chance-constrained service-level requirement. We develop a solution approach that accounts for the risk-pooling benefit of flexible capacity (a closed-loop planning approach) and compare it with a solution that is similar to Intels current practice (an open-loop planning approach). We evaluate both approaches with a realistic but disguised example and show that the closed-loop planning solution leads to savings in both equipment and inventory costs and matches more closely the service-level targets for the two products.

Research analyzing this area predominantly uses versions of the diffusion model to capture the demand trajectory of a new product with a fixed potential market. The classic Bass model assumes that demand for innovative products is influenced both by “external” media influence and “internal” word-of-mouth effect, but it excludes price and assumes that capacity is unlimited. In reality, both factors critically influence firms strategies. Price fluctuations for a new product are common, and price is often a critical lever that helps to shape the demand. Also, firms often have significant capacity constraints, which influence the feasibility of their strategies. In this paper, we consider how a capacity-constrained firm prices products during new product introductions. Thus, the demand rate is influenced by price and, when capacity is insufficient, we allow some customers to be either lost or backlogged, which slows down the word-of-mouth effect. To understand the effect of both pricing and capacity, we consider the integrated optimal pricing, production, and inventory decisions, using control-theory framework (a generalization of the classic Bass model). Most of our results are fairly robust and apply under the assumption of lost sales and partial backlogging, as well as make-to-order and make-to-stock environments. We show that in most cases, the optimal trajectory of demand is unimodal, as in the Bass model, but the optimal price trajectory and the corresponding pricing policy are more complicated when capacity is limited. Using a numerical study, we explore when pricing flexibility is most valuable and whether simple pricing policies may be effective. We find that benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is neither unlimited (very large) nor very small and when word-of-mouth effect dominates direct impact from media. The ability to adjust prices is significantly more important than the option of producing in advance and holding inventory. We also find that simple pricing policies, appropriately chosen for given capacity, perform very well.

To mitigate significant cost shocks to procurement, the buyer can diversify her supply base by selecting suppliers from different regions. We find that the buyers decision to diversify depends on her bid-taker power—that is, her ability to choose the auction mechanism. At one extreme, when the buyer has full bid-taker power and thus can dictatorially implement the optimal mechanism, she always prefers to diversify. At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bid-taker power, she generally prefers to protect herself against potential price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers by diversifying less. The managerial insight is that the more bid-taker power the buyer has to control price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers the more she prefers a diversified supply base.

In addition, multitasking significantly impacts quality of care. Although lower levels of multitasking are associated with improved quality of care, at higher levels, additional multitasking leads to a smaller number of detected diagnoses and an increased likelihood of a 24-hour revisit rate to the ED.

One common measure of successful call resolution is whether or not the call results in the customer calling back. This presents a natural trade-off between speed and quality, where speed is defined as the average time before an incoming call is answered (the average waiting time) and quality is defined as the percentage of all arriving calls that do not result in callbacks (the call resolution). The relevant control is the routing, that is, the decision concerning which agent should handle an arriving call when more than one agent is available. In an inverted-V model setting, we formulate an optimization problem with the dual performance objective of minimizing average customer waiting time and maximizing the call resolution. We solve this optimization problem asymptotically in the Halfin–Whitt many-server limit regime, interpret its solution as a routing control for the discrete-event system, and show via simulation that the interpreted routing control is on the efficient frontier. In particular, any routing control that has a lower average waiting time (higher call resolution) must also have a lower call resolution (higher average waiting time).",474.0,2013,"[(u'call', 9), (u'average', 5), (u'waiting', 4), (u'control', 4), (u'routing', 3), (u'time', 3), (u'speed', 2), (u'customers', 2), (u'handle', 2), (u'arriving', 2), (u'calling', 2), (u'(the', 2), (u'one', 2), (u'successful', 2), (u'(higher', 2), (u'customer', 2), (u'optimization', 2), (u'problem', 2), (u'defined', 2), (u'agent', 2), (u'may', 2), (u'lower', 2), (u'calls', 2), (u'resolution', 2), (u'less', 1), (u'results', 1), (u'interpreted', 1), (u'minimizing', 1), (u'inverted-v', 1), (u'inquiries,', 1), (u'show', 1), (u'presents', 1), (u'answered', 1), (u'quality,', 1), (u'setting,', 1), (u'time)', 1), (u'callbacks', 1), (u'system,', 1), (u'solution', 1), (u'common', 1), (u'discrete-event', 1), (u'resolution).', 1), (u'formulate', 1), (u'result', 1), (u'measure', 1), (u'even', 1), (u'requests.', 1), (u'decision', 1), (u'routing,', 1), (u'is,', 1)]",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
